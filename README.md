About what im doing:

Im currently working on my own GameEngine which normaly works fine except when it comes to the Graphics and Physics part.
The wrappers that im able to find are not compatible with the Microsoft Docs which is no gud.
Now im just trying to write my Managed Classes in a clr wrapper which are on the Backhand just C++ code, which i compile
seperatly because WRL or WLR idk what its called will cry about /clr in the compilation arguments.
And that clr stuff is not working the way i want it to and i cant find something to help me there.
Btw i remade my engine about 6-8 times because of Graphics and Physics and till now i developed engines a good half year
but my experience overall is about 1.7-2 Years because programming is all that makes me fun.
